# Learning AI Agent

A learning repository dedicated to AI Agent development and experimentation. This project hosts study notes, code examples, and practical implementations related to AI Agent technologies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- An LLM API account (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, etc.)

### Configuration

Create an `env.local` file in the project root and add your LLM configuration:

```shell
API_TOKEN='your-api-token-here'
ENDPOINT='https://your-llm-endpoint.com'
MODULE_NAME='your-model-name'
```

### Installation

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

```

├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
```

## Usage

After configuring your environment variables, explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `src/` directory. Simply open and run any notebook that interests you:

```shell
jupyter notebook src/
```

## Learning Resources
